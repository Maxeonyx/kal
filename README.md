# kal

Kal is my idea for a simple dynamically typed language similar to Javascript or Lua

I am drawing syntax mainly from modern JS and Rust, but I would like the language to be
embeddable like Lua (or at least have built-in bindings to call functions in the host process)

Maybe experiment with HolyJIT
